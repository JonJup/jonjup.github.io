This is an post that will hopefully keep growing with general insights and handy tips about how to answer reviewer comments. All the sources I use can be found at the end. 

From [1]  
When writing a rebuttal, there are three general principles to follow: be polite, be conciliatory and be thorough.  
If a reviewer is wrong, don't say they're wrong. Say "there seems to be a misunderstanding." If the misunderstanding arose from poor presentation, admit it and offer to fix it.   
5 Step plan : 1. Indent everything, 2. Reply to every comment, 3. Sort by importance, 4. Cut if length is limited,and 5. Polish.   
As you edit your reply, try to place yourself in the reviewer's mind. Would you be satisfied with your answers if you were them?  

From [2]  
- Never use one reviewer’s response against another.
- Say things like “we agree” or “this is an excellent point” if you are going to change your manuscript as suggested
- Pick your battles! If you can make some changes easily, go ahead. Then, if you refuse other suggestions, it looks like you are compromising with the reviewer instead of fighting them.
- Write each response so it can be ready by itself. Never refer to other responses (do not say “see the response to Reviewer 2”).

From [3]  
- Make changes in your manuscript in response to most (orall) of the comments from the referees; if an expert review-er reading your manuscript has a question, chances areother readers will too. 
- Ensure consistency between your response letter and re-vised manuscript.  

From [4]  
This is an examplary response letter. A nice idea that they use is to divide the answer in response, and changes. 

From [5] 
This is a short paper (a PLOS 10 simple rules for ...) and contains some more good insights.   
- Start with an overview of all the changes that were made
- Accept the blame, if the reviever did not understand something that is already there, change it and apologize for the unfortunate formating/ structure. 
- If possbile and sensible quote from the revised manuscript ... 
- ... but don't do so without explictily stating that you quote from the REVISED ms 
- use type, font, or indentation to differentatiate between comment, response, and changes
- Whenever possible beginn your response to each comment with a direct answer to the point being raised. 
- Write the response twice. The first one is just an orientation, a place to define to dos and visions of what you want to achieve, and last but not least to vent against reviews if nesecarry.
