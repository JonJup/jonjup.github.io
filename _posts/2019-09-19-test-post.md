title:" How to write a discussion section"

> (1) Achievements (where you paraphrase the main findings/messages in a language that, in contrast to the abstract, may assume that readers have already read some preceding parts of the paper; at first sight, this may seem redundant, but it helps ensure that readers cannot help but absorb der paperâ€™s main messages)
>
> (2) In-depth discussion of results (where you either zoom in to discussing individual results in greater depth than is possible in the results section or zoom out to consider the totality of results from an overarching perspective)
>
> (3) Previous work (where you compare the presented work with previous work from the literature in a way that, in contrast to what is suitable for the introduction section, explicitly builds on the obtained results)
>
> (4) Limitations and extensions (where you offer a suitable level of humility regarding simplifying assumptions and open questions, translating each of them into an avenue for interesting future research)
>
> (5) Summary and outlook (where you can summarize the main achievement and point out its broader implications and hoped-for impacts; this can be rather brief) 

However, note that this is of course journal-dependent. In a journal where Results and Discussion are merged, you would start with the main results and then go through 1-5 and then start a new subsection with a header and again go through 1-5. If you have separate Results and Discussion section, this may be different and there may be cases where you go from 1-5 for all results in the discussion - or where you split the discussion according to type of results and go through 1-5 for each.
Hence, it is not carved into stone - but given that for many papers the draft and revision process takes longest for the Discussion section, I think it may be helpful.
