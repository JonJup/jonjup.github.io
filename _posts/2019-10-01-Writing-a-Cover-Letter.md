[Here](https://crosstalk.cell.com/blog/submitting-your-manuscript-write-the-right-cover-letter), blog post from Crosstalk. 
Another (short) post from [Crosstalk](https://crosstalk.cell.com/blog/getting-your-paper-published-with-as-little-frustration-as-possible-2) again warns not to simply copy paste the abstract. The audience of the cover letter differs from that of the abstract and so does the message you whish to convey. The cover letter explains i) why your work is relevant and ii) a perfect fit for that journal.
